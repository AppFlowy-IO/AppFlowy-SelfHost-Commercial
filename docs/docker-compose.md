# Docker Compose

With Docker and the Docker Compose plugin installed, first copy the environment template from the repository root:

```bash
cp deploy.env .env
```

Edit `.env` to set your domain, HTTPS/WebSocket schemes, credentials, and optional email or AI settings. Replace the example passwords and JWT secret before exposing the deployment publicly. Compose [loads the root `.env` automatically](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/variable-interpolation/), and Git ignores this file.

Compose uses the public `appflowyinc/appflowy_cloud` and `appflowyinc/appflowy_worker` images. Both provide AMD64 and ARM64 builds, and Docker selects the image architecture for your host automatically.

Nginx configuration and certificates remain in [`docker/nginx`](../docker/nginx). For HTTPS, replace the bundled development certificate and key in `docker/nginx/ssl/` with your deployment's certificates.

For an existing installation, complete the [Redis persistence migration](#redis-persistence) before recreating Redis. For a new installation, start the services from the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

With the default localhost settings, open [AppFlowy Web](http://localhost) or the [Admin console](http://localhost/console). The template creates the admin account `admin@example.com` with password `password`.

If upgrading an installation previously started from `docker/`, move its existing `.env` to the repository root and retain its Compose project name. For the old default, add `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=docker` to `.env`; if you used a custom project name, keep that value. This reuses the existing named data volumes and the default network. Containers whose definition changed are recreated in place: `nginx` and `appflowy_cloud` leave the old `cloud_proxy` network, and `minio`, `appflowy_cloud`, and `appflowy_worker` move to new image references. Unchanged service definitions are reused; Redis requires the persistence migration below. The old `<project>_cloud_proxy` network is left behind and can be removed with `docker network rm` after the upgrade.

## Redis persistence

The bundled Redis service enables AOF with `appendfsync everysec`, uses `maxmemory-policy noeviction`, and stores `/data` in the Compose-managed `redis_data` volume. Pending work survives container recreation when this volume is retained. One-second fsync still permits recent writes to be lost in a crash; keep durable backups and provision memory/disk capacity for your workload. This change does not set a memory limit or enable hosted storage quotas in self-host builds.

When upgrading the previous Redis service, its existing anonymous `/data` volume is **not** automatically copied into `redis_data`. Before running `docker compose up` with this change:

1. Pause Redis writers and back up the existing dataset. Keep the existing container and volume until migration is verified.
2. Enable AOF on the running Redis with `redis-cli CONFIG SET appendonly yes`. Use `INFO persistence` to confirm `aof_rewrite_in_progress=0`, `aof_rewrite_scheduled=0`, and `aof_last_bgrewrite_status=ok` before stopping it. See [Redis's AOF migration procedure](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence/#how-i-can-switch-to-aof-if-im-currently-using-dumprdb-snapshots).
3. Stop Redis and copy its complete `/data` contents, including the AOF directory and manifest, into the new project's `redis_data` volume while retaining file ownership. Start Redis with the new configuration and verify the dataset before resuming writers.

Retain the Compose project name so subsequent recreations select the same volume. `docker compose down -v` removes deployment data volumes; it is not an upgrade command. External Redis deployments need equivalent persistence settings on their own servers.

## OAuth providers

The [`gotrue` service](../docker-compose.yml) forwards Google, GitHub, and Discord OAuth settings from the root `.env`. The settings are listed in [`deploy.env`](../deploy.env).

For provider setup instructions, see the [authentication guide](AUTHENTICATION.md).

Set `FQDN` and `SCHEME` for your public deployment URL before configuring a provider. Register an OAuth application with that provider and set its callback URL to `${API_EXTERNAL_URL}/callback`, which resolves to `https://your-domain/gotrue/callback` for an HTTPS deployment.

Update the matching provider settings in `.env`. For example, for Google:

```dotenv
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_ENABLED=true
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET=your-client-secret
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=${API_EXTERNAL_URL}/callback
```

For GitHub or Discord, use the corresponding `GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_*` or `GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_DISCORD_*` settings. Leave providers you do not use disabled.

Apply the updated environment from the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up -d gotrue
```

## SAML

For Okta, follow the [SAML setup guide](OKTA_SAML.md). The SAML settings forwarded to GoTrue are `GOTRUE_SAML_ENABLED` and `GOTRUE_SAML_PRIVATE_KEY`; configure them in the root `.env`.

## Enterprise identity

SCIM provisioning, custom OIDC / OAuth providers, and LDAP sign-in are configured in the Admin console rather than through `.env`. See [SCIM Provisioning](SCIM.md), [OIDC / OAuth](OIDC.md), and [LDAP](LDAP.md). The bundled [`docker/nginx/nginx.conf`](../docker/nginx/nginx.conf) already routes `/scim` to AppFlowy Cloud and sets `X-Forwarded-For` for `/api`; if you use a customized Nginx configuration, the SCIM and LDAP guides show the exact directives to add.
