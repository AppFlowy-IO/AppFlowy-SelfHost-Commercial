# Docker Compose

With Docker and the Docker Compose plugin installed, first copy the environment template from the repository root:

```bash
cp deploy.env .env
```

Edit `.env` to set your domain, HTTPS/WebSocket schemes, credentials, and optional email or AI settings. Replace the example passwords and JWT secret before exposing the deployment publicly. Compose [loads the root `.env` automatically](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/variable-interpolation/), and Git ignores this file.

Compose uses the public `appflowyinc/appflowy_cloud` and `appflowyinc/appflowy_worker` images. Both provide AMD64 and ARM64 builds, and Docker selects the image architecture for your host automatically.

Nginx configuration and certificates remain in [`docker/nginx`](../docker/nginx). For HTTPS, replace the bundled development certificate and key in `docker/nginx/ssl/` with your deployment's certificates.

Start the services from the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

With the default localhost settings, open [AppFlowy Web](http://localhost) or the [Admin console](http://localhost/console). The template creates the admin account `admin@example.com` with password `password`.

If upgrading an installation previously started from `docker/`, move its existing `.env` to the repository root and retain its Compose project name. For the old default, add `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=docker` to `.env`; if you used a custom project name, keep that value. This reuses the existing named data volumes and the default network. Containers whose definition changed are recreated in place: `nginx` and `appflowy_cloud` leave the old `cloud_proxy` network, and `minio`, `appflowy_cloud`, and `appflowy_worker` move to new image references. Unchanged service definitions are reused. The old `<project>_cloud_proxy` network is left behind and can be removed with `docker network rm` after the upgrade.

## Storage and Redis

PostgreSQL, MinIO, and Search use the named volumes `postgres_data`, `minio_data`, and `keyword_index_data`. Retain the Compose project name when recreating containers so they select the same volumes. `docker compose down -v` removes deployment data volumes; it is not an upgrade command.

Redis uses the image's default command. The root Compose file does not configure AOF, an explicit named Redis data volume, or a Redis health check. It does not guarantee that Redis-backed queues or pending work survive container replacement. Retaining PostgreSQL and MinIO data does not establish Redis queue durability.

For a local Swarm installation, follow the [Docker Swarm guide](docker-swarm.md). It uses a separate stack and direct Docker commands; the [deployment CI guide](deployment-ci.md) describes the automated checks and their limits.

## OAuth providers

The [`gotrue` service](../docker-compose.yml) forwards Google, GitHub, and Discord OAuth settings from the root `.env`. The settings are listed in [`deploy.env`](../deploy.env).

For provider setup instructions, see the [authentication guide](AUTHENTICATION.md).

Set `FQDN` and `SCHEME` for your public deployment URL before configuring a provider. Register an OAuth application with that provider and set its callback URL to `${API_EXTERNAL_URL}/callback`, which resolves to `https://your-domain/gotrue/callback` for an HTTPS deployment.

Update the matching provider settings in `.env`. For example, for Google:

```dotenv
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_ENABLED=true
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET=your-client-secret
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=${API_EXTERNAL_URL}/callback
```

For GitHub or Discord, use the corresponding `GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_*` or `GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_DISCORD_*` settings. Leave providers you do not use disabled.

Apply the updated environment from the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up -d gotrue
```

## SAML

For Okta, follow the [SAML setup guide](OKTA_SAML.md). The SAML settings forwarded to GoTrue are `GOTRUE_SAML_ENABLED` and `GOTRUE_SAML_PRIVATE_KEY`; configure them in the root `.env`.

## Enterprise identity

SCIM provisioning, custom OIDC / OAuth providers, and LDAP sign-in are configured in the Admin console rather than through `.env`. See [SCIM Provisioning](SCIM.md), [OIDC / OAuth](OIDC.md), and [LDAP](LDAP.md). The bundled [`docker/nginx/nginx.conf`](../docker/nginx/nginx.conf) already routes `/scim` to AppFlowy Cloud and sets `X-Forwarded-For` for `/api`; if you use a customized Nginx configuration, the SCIM and LDAP guides show the exact directives to add.

## Search admission

This Compose deployment includes Search and sets `APPFLOWY_SEARCH_ENABLED=true` by default.
Set it to `false` when deliberately deploying without Search. It supplies the initial and reset
value; an Admin **Environment → Search** override is stored in PostgreSQL and takes precedence,
including after restarts. Worker, MCP, and Search observe the same stored setting without
requiring their environments to be changed.

Disabling stops new Search tasks and pauses Search consumers after propagation (notification
plus a five-second recovery poll). Existing durable work is retained. Re-enabling reconciles
content changed while disabled; temporary Search outages do not disable task admission.
AI and individual indexing capabilities retain their own narrower controls.

Upgrade Cloud, Worker, Search, and MCP together, with Cloud migrations completing first.
Older binaries do not implement this runtime gate.
